        <p class="odd-p">Hello world, My name is Mandy. I'm a student at Georgian College, a mother, and lowly servant to the cats
            that run my house. Some of  my favourite things are; going on adventures with my family, reading a book with
            a seasonally flavoured hot beverage, and card nights at my parents' house. I was born in Newmarket. My family moved to Barrie when I was young and I have, for the
            most part, lived here ever since.
        </p> 

        <p id="middle-p">I would consider my greatest achievement to be raising a kind, clever, happy child. (Yes, I am aware of how
            cliche that sounds.) Watching her laugh, grow and learn to navigate this crazy world is something that makes
            me proud every day.

        </p>

        <p class="odd-p">My main priority / goal right now is completing my first year of post-secondary education with good grades
            and a thorough understanding of the material taught. My 5 year goals are graduating from the CMPA program
            and finding a career that I enjoy in the industry. My long term goals include being a home owner, collecting
            as many Christmas decorations as my house will hold and to laugh as loud and as often as possible.
